      <p>This week, we went over the basics of malware. The introduction to malware included why malware exists, who is behind it, and what their motivations are. When I read through the main motivations of hackers, I found it easy to think of examples of each motivation. For instance, the recon/spying motivation reminded me of the Russian hacking and influence in the 2016 United States election. I also thought it was valuable to learn the main roles as an anti-malware researcher. To be an effective anti-malware researcher, one must be able to understand and describe the threat, which is what made this week's homework so valuable. Looking at the malware with several different tools made it easier to understand what the evil.exe file was trying to accomplish. <br><br>
	We also learned several malware-related definitions, such as white, which is equivalent to clean, and the meaning of a "goat", which I had never heard of before. The goat something you sacrifice to learn more about a certain instance of malware. I spent a good deal of time thinking about the fact that the user is the biggest infection vector, and I reflected back to my security training at my job. The security training we were required to complete focused mostly on what you can do as a user to prevent infections from malicious software that is spread through channels such as email.<br><br>
	Many of the concepts within the first lecture were familiar to me already. For instance, I know that Trojan horses trick users into opening them because they appear to be receiving legitimate software, or files from a legitimate source, and I also know that spyware collects personal information without the user's knowledge as if it's "spying" on you. But not all concepts were familiar, and I thought the name deciphering was extremely valuable because I was not aware of the naming conventions of malware. I feel that there is a lack of information when it comes to the general public being able to identify files that may be malware on their computer. <br><br>
	One thing I have always been interested in learning more about is the U.S. Military's relationship with cybersecurity. I thought it was especially interesting to learn that the U.S. Air-force analysts created the term "Advanced Persistent Threats" in 2006 to describe the aspects of attackers that represent their profile, intent, and structure. I learned that the kill-chain related to this term involves several steps: Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command and Control, and finally Actions on Objectives. 
<br><br>	In summary, I learned several new malware terms and definitions, naming conventions, online analysis services and tools, the basics of replication and setup, and I performed some sample execution within the VM with the recommended tools. One of the most valuable things I learned this week is that naming conventions of malware are extremely similar to the Windows naming conventions. VirusTotal and WepaWet are valuable tools for analysis of all kinds of malware, and replication is also a valuable strategy for analyzing malware. The best way to replicate for analysis is keeping anti-virus software or firewalls off your computer so that the malware can break out and you can study it. There was much more interesting information within the lectures this week, but these were the items that I thought were most interesting.</p>

    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>This week, we went over advanced forensics in cybersecurity. We learned abou IR and forensics methods, core Windows forensic techniques, Windows Registry Primer, file and directory analysis, data recovery with PhotoRec, and we performed four labs. Forensic computing is, "the process of identifying, preserving, analyzing and presenting digital evidence in a manner that is legally acceptable." In this context, evidence is anything you can use to prove or disprove a fact. We learned about some basic evidence handling procedures and the Instant Response process. The Instant Response process starts with an incidence response team, moving on to incident detection, initial response, formulating a response, moving through a legal
	    phase that includes investigating through data collection and forensic analysis, documenting findings in the administrative phase and then remediation and evaluation.<br><br>
	    We also learned that physical memory is the short-term memory of a computer that experiences a rapid decay of information as soon as the memory module is disconnected from power and clock sources. When we dump the memory, there is the potential to obtain all running processes at the time of the memory snapshot, all loaded modules and dynamic link libraries, all running device drivers, and much more. It was interesting to learn that every process within Windows is assigned 4GiB of Virtual Memory, split into halves. When memory is dumped, analyzing sysinternals' strings is a difficult way to interpret events. There is no context and the strings are difficult to interpret what string is associated with which program.<br><br>
	    Two of the major tools we learned about this week were Volatility and Yara. Volatility is an advanced memory forensics framework written in Python. With Volatility you can write and create your own plugins, which are useful for malware detection. We used Volatility within the labs this week along with several plugins. Yara is a tool desinged to help malware researchers identify and classify malware samples. Yarascan is a plugin for Volatility that can scan a memory image for a yara signature. When used with a rule file or with a definition of what you are looking for, Yarascan can narrow down the search to find specific items. <br><br>
	    Within the lab, we demonstrated several Volatility plugin examples, such as dlllist -p <pid>, netscan
	      deskscan, and getsids. The command to run volatility with these plugins on the memory dump is volatility.exe -f <name of memory dump> plugin. We used imageinfo to image the date and time from the machine with the memory dump. The -h flag is the help option for Volatility. One example of the result of running the plugins was running the command "volatility-2.3.1.standalone.exe -f memdump_sample1.mem --profile=Win7SP0x86 psscan". This command displays processes with parent IDs, which can be valuable for tracing malware back to the source.<br><br>
	      Within the Core Windows Forensics section we learned about Windows Registry Primer. The idea behind this is that everything done in Windows refers to or is recorded into the Registry. RegMon (Sysinternals) can be used to display registry activity in real time, which is valuable because the Registry is referenced in one way or another with every action taken by the user. One tool recommended in the lectures was Regripper, which is a forensic investigation tool on the Registry. I was eager to learn more about the Registry since last week's lab, where Registry keys kept popping up within Process Monitor. One recommendation we received in this week's lectures in order to help us seen the Registry as one unified "file system" is opening the Registry Editor by typing the command "regedit" in the run window. The five most hierarchal folders are called 'hives' and begin with 'HKEY',
	      which I was very familiar with seeing within the tools from last week's labs. The two real hives that can be seen are HKEY_USERS (HKU) and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE (HKLM). We call these the 'real' hives because the other three are shortcuts or aliases to branches within one of the two previously mentioned hives. Each hive is composed of keys, which contain values and subkeys. The values of the keys are the names of certain items within a key; these help identify specific values related to the operating system or applications depending on that value.<br><br>
	      Other key artifacts related to forensic computing are System Restore Points, Pagefile.sys, the hibernation file, crash-dump files, LNK files, and shell-bag. The lectures also discussed AutoRun locations, MRU lists, UserAssist, Geolocation through wired and wireless networks, USB devices, and Internet Explorer as tools to gather evidence about the Registry as your forensics log. One term that was emphasized within the lectures was the MFT, or the Master-file table. This table is relevant because the timing of events, or timeline, typically becomes the core of the investigation. Creation and modify times that are set around the period of file access can help a forensic investigator gain insight into the actions that took place on the system and the files the attackers touched. A larger picture emerges once you
	      correlate this evidence with other time stamped files like Windows events logs. Volatility is one tool that allows you to create a timeline, along with $MFT, Reg-ripper, and timeliner, which gives you an overview of what happens in the system. MFT parser also gives you a history of what happened on the system. <br><br>
	      Next, a forensic investigator can look for relevant files (such as pagefile.sys, index.dat, etc.), Windows event logs, application configuration files and logs, the prefetch folder
	     , and evidence of malware when browsing the offline filesystem. The system and application event logs are very useful, with many tools available for extracting them. This also goes for security and DNS logs. We can also analyze the IIS/webserver/FTP logs/URLScan, which is useful to detect webapp exploiting, as well as the Windows Firewall log with %windir%\pfirewall.log. Dr. Watson logs contain information about processes running when an application crashed, and setupapi.log contains information about installation of applications and devices. schedlgu.txt contains information about scheduled tasks, which would have been helpful for the first lab, as one main piece of evidence was that the malware scheduled tasks every thirty minutes in the future. 
	      The last set of logs that were recommended for file and directory analysis were the antivirus/IDS/IAS/ISA Server/ logs. <br><br>
	      The final topic we covered this week was data recovery. This process recovers files or data deleted or in slack from the system. Investigators can identify when the files were deleted, look for fragments and unrecoverable data, recover pertinent files, including images and emails. The was relevant for the last tool we learned and demonstrated, PhotoRec. PhotoRec carves out files in an image based on headers. The output directory specified will contain all the files recovered. <br><br>
