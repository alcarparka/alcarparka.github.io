    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>This week, we went over the basics of malware. The introduction to malware included why malware exists, who is behind it, and what their motivations are. When I read through the main motivations of hackers, I found it easy to think of examples of each motivation. For instance, the recon/spying motivation reminded me of the Russian hacking and influence in the 2016 United States election. I also thought it was valuable to learn the main roles as an anti-malware researcher. To be an effective anti-malware researcher, one must be able to understand and describe the threat, which is what made this week's homework so valuable. Looking at the malware with several different tools made it easier to understand what the evil.exe file was trying to accomplish. <br><br>
	We also learned several malware-related definitions, such as white, which is equivalent to clean, and the meaning of a "goat", which I had never heard of before. The goat something you sacrifice to learn more about a certain instance of malware. I spent a good deal of time thinking about the fact that the user is the biggest infection vector, and I reflected back to my security training at my job. The security training we were required to complete focused mostly on what you can do as a user to prevent infections from malicious software that is spread through channels such as email.<br><br>
	Many of the concepts within the first lecture were familiar to me already. For instance, I know that Trojan horses trick users into opening them because they appear to be receiving legitimate software, or files from a legitimate source, and I also know that spyware collects personal information without the user's knowledge as if it's "spying" on you. But not all concepts were familiar, and I thought the name deciphering was extremely valuable because I was not aware of the naming conventions of malware. I feel that there is a lack of information when it comes to the general public being able to identify files that may be malware on their computer. <br><br>
	One thing I have always been interested in learning more about is the U.S. Military's relationship with cybersecurity. I thought it was especially interesting to learn that the U.S. Air-force analysts created the term "Advanced Persistent Threats" in 2006 to describe the aspects of attackers that represent their profile, intent, and structure. I learned that the kill-chain related to this term involves several steps: Reconnaissance, Weaponization, Delivery, Exploitation, Installation, Command and Control, and finally Actions on Objectives. 
<br><br>	In summary, I learned several new malware terms and definitions, naming conventions, online analysis services and tools, the basics of replication and setup, and I performed some sample execution within the VM with the recommended tools. One of the most valuable things I learned this week is that naming conventions of malware are extremely similar to the Windows naming conventions. VirusTotal and WepaWet are valuable tools for analysis of all kinds of malware, and replication is also a valuable strategy for analyzing malware. The best way to replicate for analysis is keeping anti-virus software or firewalls off your computer so that the malware can break out and you can study it. There was much more interesting information within the lectures this week, but these were the items that I thought were most interesting.</p>
