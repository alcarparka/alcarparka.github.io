    <div class="w3-container">
      <p>This week, we went over the basics of malware. The introduction to malware included why malware exists, who is behind it, and what their motivations are. When I read through the main motivations of hackers, I found it easy to think of examples of each time of motivation. For instance, the recon/spying motivation reminded me of the Russian hacking and influence in the United States Election in 2016. I also thought it was valuable to learn the main roles as an anti-malware researcher. To be an effective anti-malware researcher, one must be able to understand and describe the threat, which is what made this week's homework so valuable. Looking at the malware with several different tools made it easier to understand what the evil.exe file was trying to accomplish. 
	We also learned several malware related defintions, such as white, which is equivalent to clean, and the meaning of a "goat", which I had never heard of before. The goat something you sacrifice to learn more about a certain instance of malware. I spent a good deal of time thinking about the fact that the user is the biggest infection vector, and I reflected back to my security training at my job. The security training we were required to complete focused mostly on what you can do as a user to prevent infections from malicious software that is spread through channels such as email.</p>
